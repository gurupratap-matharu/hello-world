# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

I think GitHub is a great place to learn to code as well read about many open source projects.
I am very curious to learn Git and contribute in every way possible. I am full for opensource and believe that the coding community is very nice and warm to new comers.

I've started to program very late in life I feel but nevertheless I wanna go full swing. So many tutorials and open source free books are available that encourage me and I feel I can do it.

I want to use this readme file as a thank you for every one who's helping me to learn to code.

I owe you all a big one.
